## 🧠 About The Project

This project combines **Computer Vision + AI + Game Development** to create a touchless gaming experience.

Instead of pressing keys, the player controls the bird using **hand gestures detected via webcam**.

It uses:
- 📷 OpenCV for video processing
- ✋ MediaPipe for hand tracking
- 🎮 Pygame for game development

---

## 🔥 Features

✅ Real-time hand tracking  
✅ Gesture-based jump control  
✅ Smooth gameplay  
✅ Clean modular code  
✅ Beginner-friendly AI + Game integration

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hashim-stack/ai-gesture-flappy-bird
cd gesture-flappy
```

### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Run The Game

```bash
python game.py
```

Make sure your webcam is connected 🎥

---

## 🖐️ How It Works
1. Webcam captures live video.
2. MediaPipe detects hand landmarks.
3. Gesture logic detects hand movement.
4. If gesture is detected → Bird jumps.
5. Avoid pipes and score high!
